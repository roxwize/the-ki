        <h2>A new blog</h2>
        <p>It's better late than never I got around to making this. As of now I'm not entirely sure of what I'll eventually add to it (or if I'll eventually just give up on it entirely), but for the time being, this is something I have created. I have made this blog from scratch. And it will be so much better than the blog on my Neocities website. It WILL have pagination. And it WILL have RSS. Eventually. For now this is infinitesimally worse and less fully-featured than my old blog. Will I port all my old posts over for archival purposes? I dunno. Maybe. I should go to sleep.</p>
